## Who is this for?

This flake is for developers who just want to develop Bevy on their NixOS
system, while also having the ability to distribute their games to other
operating systems, without needing to rely on GitHub Actions, or the like.

It is designed to be as close to a drop-in solution as possible, such that
users can easily integrate it into their existing workflow.

*This flake is not made for packaging your game for Nix. For that you should
use something like [Naersk.][naersk]*
