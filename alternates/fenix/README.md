# `fenix`

This version of `bevy-flake` uses the `nix-community/fenix` overlay for the
rust toolchain.

I'm thinking of going with this instead of `oxalica/rust-overlay`, because I
like the interface better, and because it seems to be faster to build and uses
less disk space.

Was last tested on Bevy version: `16.1`
